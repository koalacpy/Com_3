<p>Please put your browser in full screen. Again, you must not use a touchscreen device to complete this task (a physical mouse or trackpad, as on a laptop, is fine). 
This task involves audio, so please make sure you are in a quiet environment; headphones are recommended. 
You will not be able to complete the task properly without functioning audio.</p>

<p><b>Instructions</b></p>
<p>
You will be shown some images and will be required to listen to instructions to click one of them.
These audio instructions were generated by an individual who was asked to direct a listener to choose a certain image.
This experiment has been designed to test how effectively individual speakers were able to convey instructions by observing a listenerâ€™s responses.
Particularly, we are interested in how fast you are able to select the right image, so please answer as quickly as possible, while still remaining accurate. 
To speed up your answer, you should begin moving the cursor as soon as you have a hunch about which image you're supposed to select.
Ideally, you will click on the right image before the audio completely finishes playing.
However, it is important that you <b>do not begin moving the cursor until you're getting ready to click</b> 
-- try to keep your cursor on the Go button until the audio starts and you're selecting the image.
</p>

<p>We understand that it can be difficult to respond so quickly, so just do your best! You'll have a few practice trials to get accustomed to the timing of the speaker that you've been assigned.</p>

<p>This entire task needs to be done in a single sitting, which should take about 20 minutes. You may take breaks if you need to, but please do so in between trials (i.e. not when there are images on the screen).</p>
