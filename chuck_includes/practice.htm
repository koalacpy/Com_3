<p><b>Practice</b></p>
<p>
In each trial, you will be shown four images. After a couple seconds have passed, a 'Go' button will appear near the bottom of your screen.
When you click the 'Go' button, audio instructions will begin to play. 
  </p>
<p>Try to remember three main rules:</p>
  <p>1: Try to keep your mouse still immediately after clicking 'Go'.</p>
  <p>2: Move your mouse as soon as you have a hunch or vague idea about which object you're supposed to click (but not before then).</p>
  <p>3: If the audio finishes and you haven't moved your mouse yet, you're too slow!</p>
  
<p>The timing of this experiment can be tricky at first, and that's okay! You will receive feedback if you're moving your mouse too fast or too slow.</p>

<p>We'll start with a few practice trials so you can get used to the rhythm. Click 'Start' when you're ready!</p>
